Hi! I'm Michiel. I'm currently a mobile developer at [Flow Pilots](http://www.flowpilots.com).

On here I'll post some opinions, issues, challenges and other interesting titbits I run into. At the moment I'm mainly involved with C# / Xamarin / Android stacks. Initial posts can be expected to touch on those topics.

Hope you find something useful here!
