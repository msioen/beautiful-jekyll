Hi! I'm Michiel. I'm currently a mobile developer at [Flow Pilots](https://www.flowpilots.com). Before my current job I worked for 4 years at the University of Central Lancashire as an interactive C# developer.

On here I'll post some opinions, issues, challenges and other interesting titbits I run into. Blog posts are often the result of experimentation or wild ideas, because of this there's a wild range of technologies and topics covered.

Hope you find something useful here!
