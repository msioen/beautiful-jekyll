Hi! I'm Michiel. I'm currently a mobile developer at [Flow Pilots](http://www.flowpilots.com). Before my current job I worked for 4 years at the University of Central Lancashire as an interactive C# developer.

On here I'll post some opinions, issues, challenges and other interesting titbits I run into. As it turns out, I'm finding it really hard to stick to one topic. The main theme across posts however will remain C#.

Hope you find something useful here!
